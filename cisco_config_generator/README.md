# The Cisco config generator

Script is written by my good friend ZaCake and is used to generate Cisco config for his workplace.
I did not write this myself but i am adding it to the repo because it helped me learn python.

Great example on how to use python for automation in the Ops/DevOps space.
Scripts are purely functional and does not utilize OOP or python to their full extent.

All files are untouched by me other than this README file, the config script and in place "clean" configs are sanitized for customer specific info such as passwords and descriptions.
Therefor these scripts do not work in production without additional changes.
Please notify me of any security issues found in the source.
